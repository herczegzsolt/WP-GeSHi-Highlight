Fast syntax highlighting for many languages. Clean, small, and valid (X)HTML. Highly&easily configurable.


== Description ==
**I) Features:**

* Syntax highlighting for [**many languages**](http://gehrcke.de/files/perm/wp-geshi-highlight/wp-geshi-highlight_languages_1_0_5.txt) (based on [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)).
* **Line numbers**.
* Extremely **simple to use**. If desired, **styles are highly&easily configurable**.
* Multiple code blocks on a single web page? Each one **can** get its own style.

**II) Possible advantages over other highlighters:**

* Use of numbered lists to create line numbers -> Code-number-displacements **never** occur!
* Copy/paste keeps formatting. Line numbers are not copied.
* Uses CSS classes: **clean and small HTML output**.
* **Valid** (X)HTML output.
* Only minimal waste of CPU cycles if there is nothing to highlight.
* High **performance**.
* Clean and well-documented source code.

**III) Usage:**

Bear in mind: don't use the visual post editor! Then, it's very simple:

`<pre lang="languagestring">
    CODE
</pre>`

This is a short example:

`<pre lang="bash">
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=image.ext3 bs=1M count=10000 oflag=append conv=notrunc
</pre>`

All available options are listed and explained on the [plugin's homepage](http://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight).

**IV) How does it look in action?**

Examples can be found on the [plugin's homepage](http://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight/#examples).

**V) Issues:**

**Please** let me know about them!

1. Use it :-)




== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I change the starting line number? =

Yes, try e.g. line="13". But this [breaks](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/geshi-doc.html#starting-line-numbers) XHTML strict compliance.



== Screenshots ==
1. This screenshot shows WP-GeSHi-Highlight in action. Furthermore, it visualizes how code blocks on the same page can have different styles (which is very easy to accomplish using WP-GeSHi-Highlight).
