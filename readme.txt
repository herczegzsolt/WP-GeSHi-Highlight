Fast syntax highlighting for many languages. Simple usage. Based on GeSHi (well-established & award-winning PHP highlighter). Valid HTML output.

== Description ==
**I) Highlights:**

* Syntax highlighting for [**many** languages](http://gehrcke.de/files/perm/wp-geshi-highlight/wp-geshi-highlight_languages_1_0_8.txt).
* Stability, performance, and security inherited from [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/).
* Optional line numbering. Code-number displacements do not occur. Numbers are not copied in most browsers.
* Simple usage.
* Per-block styles: each code block on a single web page can retrieve its own style.
* Clean, small, valid HTML output.
* No waste of CPU cycles when there is nothing to highlight.
* Well-documented source code.

WP-GeSHi-Highlight is a largely rewritten version of [WP-Syntax](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/). Compared to WP-Syntax, WP-GeSHi-Highlight

* creates valid HTML when line numbering is activated (via GeSHi's [GESHI_HEADER_PRE_VALID](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/geshi-doc.html#the-code-container) setting).
* creates less HTML source code.
* delivers a default style sheet making use of modern CSS properties.
* has more styling flexibility.
* has the cleaner source code.
* makes usage of up-to-date WordPress API calls.

**II) Usage:**
Bear in mind: don't use the visual post editor. Insert code blocks just like this:

`<pre lang="languagestring">
    CODE
</pre>`

A short example:

`<pre lang="bash">
    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=image.ext3 bs=1M count=10000 oflag=append conv=notrunc
</pre>`

All available options are listed and explained on the [plugin's website](http://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight).
